This repository is a research archive and contains everything you need to run my assignment for the course "Introduction to Bayesian Statistics." The PDF file contains the final report. The file manuscript_inan.Rmd contains the script and text. Code-chunks follow after paragraphs in which their relevant content is introduced. The three .csv files are the data files that I use from Our World In Data. To walk through the research project, read the text in the .Rmd file and look at the respective code-chunks. If you do not care about the details, I suggest to just read the PDF file. 

Below is a documentation of what happens at which line of code. I do not suggest to read this part (although it is in the README file), but you can use it if you want to navigate the file in more detail later.

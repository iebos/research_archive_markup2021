This repository is a research archive and contains everything you need to run my assignment for the course "Introduction to Bayesian Statistics." The PDF and HTML file both contain the final report. The file manuscript_inan.Rmd contains the script and text. Code-chunks follow after paragraphs in which their relevant content is introduced. The three .csv files are the data files that I use from Our World In Data. To walk through the research project, read the text in the .Rmd file and look at the respective code-chunks. If you do not care about the details, I suggest to just read the PDF file.
